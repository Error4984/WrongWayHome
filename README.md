# Wrong Way Home
Looks like LIMBO at the start, the closer you get to home the more solemn and monotone everything gets.
The further the more cheerful it gets and it starts revealing that something happened there you dont know what it never tells you
Music is piano that gets more upbeat the further away you get
The camera will have a slight pull to the door music fades footstep volume increases fog thickens
the further you get the more memories you remember
